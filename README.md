Travel Management System

📘 Overview

The Travel Management System is a web-based application designed to simplify and organize the travel data recording process for employees especially surveyors using vendor or third party vehicles. This system ensures accurate tracking of vehicle usage by employees through the submission of structured forms. It eliminates the inefficiencies of the previous WhatsApp-based process and provides centralized access for admins and the finance department to generate reports and manage records.
